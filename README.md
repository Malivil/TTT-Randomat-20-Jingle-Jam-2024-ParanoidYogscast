# NOTE: This is ONLY USABLE by the Yogscast as it plays sound clips using their voices and specifically checks for their SteamIDs.
You can install it if you want but it will never run unless you manually trigger it, bypassing the condition checks. It plays incriminating clips from their TTT videos so unless you're playing with them, it would have no effect on gameplay really.
